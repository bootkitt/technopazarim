<h1>TechnoPazarim Digital Goods Shops</h1>

Welcome! I will share with you a Web Script that I made when I just learned programming. TechnoPazarim is basically a promotional page that supports the sale of digital products.   
Basically, it has an architecture that collects all the content on a single page. You can use it in your shop or develop it. 

It has a simple and easily editable structure. 
You can access all information from the administration panel or database.
It consists of four sections: Home - Buy - About Us - Contact Us.
There is a title about the product, product price, product content and buy button.
The buy button was designed to be directed to only one target site. You can change this if you want.

I was thinking of developing this project, but the development process was interrupted due to the fact that I was studying at university and could not obtain capital financially. 
Of course, I am publishing it so that those who have time or other people can develop this project.
